Exercise 6:
a)
Age is protected because it should be accessible by other child classes but first name and lst name is private because it cannot be accessed directly outside the classes without getters and setters.

b)
Error:
Person::first_name is inaccessible
Person::last_name is inaccessible

c)
We got this error because class Person is inherited in a Public mode and private members of class Person are inaccessible in other child classes i.e Student class. We have to use getters and setters to avoid this error.
